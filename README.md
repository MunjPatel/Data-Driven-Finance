# Data-Driven Finance: Clustering Algorithms and Dimensionality Reduction in Risk and Portfolio Management

This repository contains the code accompanying the Medium article: [Data-Driven Finance: Clustering Algorithms and Dimensionality Reduction in Risk and Portfolio Management](https://medium.com/@patelmunj2011/data-driven-finance-clustering-algorithms-and-dimensionality-reduction-in-risk-and-portfolio-9eeb055046ad).

## Overview

The code demonstrates the application of multivariate data analysis techniques, specifically dimensionality reduction and clustering, in financial risk management. By analyzing datasets with multiple correlated variables, such as stock prices and bond yields, these techniques help in simplifying complex data and identifying patterns that are crucial for building resilient portfolios and mitigating risks.

## Repository Structure

- `dimensionality_reduction/`: Python scripts for step-by-step implementations of the discussed dimensionality reduction techniques.
- `clustering/`: Python scripts for step-by-step implementations of the discussed clustering techniques.

## Usage

The python scripts provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the analysis. Each script is self-contained and can be executed independently.

## **Summary of Multivariate Data Analysis Methods in Risk Management**

| **Method**       | **Application**                | **Outcome**                                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PCA**           | Portfolio Risk Analysis       | Identifies systemic risk drivers and simplifies portfolio VaR computation.                   |
| **LDA**           | Credit Risk Categorization    | Separates borrowers into categories based on financial metrics, minimizing classification risk. |
| **t-SNE**         | Detecting Market Anomalies    | Highlights local clusters or anomalies in financial market data.                             |
| **K-Means**       | Portfolio Diversification     | Groups similar assets to reduce concentration risk.                                          |
| **Hierarchical**  | Systemic Risk Detection       | Reveals relationships and co-movement among assets during crises.                           |
| **DBSCAN**        | Outlier Detection             | Flags outliers and irregular patterns in market data for further investigation.              |

### **1. PCA: Portfolio Risk Analysis**
- **Application**: PCA identifies systemic risks in a portfolio by isolating key factors contributing to asset volatility.
- **Outcome**: Simplifies portfolio risk management, allowing easier computation of Value-at-Risk (VaR).

---

### **2. LDA: Credit Risk Categorization**
- **Application**: Categorizes borrowers into credit risk groups based on financial metrics such as income, debt ratio, and payment history.
- **Outcome**: Minimizes classification risk by optimizing the separation of risk classes.

---

### **3. t-SNE: Detecting Market Anomalies**
- **Application**: Detects hidden clusters or anomalies in financial datasets by preserving local structures in high-dimensional data.
- **Outcome**: Highlights irregular patterns or potential risks in market data.

---

### **4. K-Means: Portfolio Diversification**
- **Application**: Groups similar assets based on return profiles and risk characteristics to improve diversification.
- **Outcome**: Reduces concentration risk by identifying clusters of assets behaving similarly.

---

### **5. Hierarchical Clustering: Systemic Risk Detection**
- **Application**: Visualizes relationships and dependencies among assets using a dendrogram structure.
- **Outcome**: Identifies systemic risks, such as assets that co-move during financial crises.

---

### **6. DBSCAN: Outlier Detection**
- **Application**: Flags outliers and irregular patterns in stock returns or other financial datasets.
- **Outcome**: Detects anomalies that may indicate risk or market inefficiencies.
