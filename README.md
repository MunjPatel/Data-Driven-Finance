# Data-Driven Finance: Clustering Algorithms and Dimensionality Reduction in Risk and Portfolio Management

This repository contains the code accompanying the Medium article: [Data-Driven Finance: Clustering Algorithms and Dimensionality Reduction in Risk and Portfolio Management](https://medium.com/@patelmunj2011/data-driven-finance-clustering-algorithms-and-dimensionality-reduction-in-risk-and-portfolio-9eeb055046ad).

## Overview

The code demonstrates the application of multivariate data analysis techniques, specifically dimensionality reduction and clustering, in financial risk management. By analyzing datasets with multiple correlated variables, such as stock prices and bond yields, these techniques help in simplifying complex data and identifying patterns that are crucial for building resilient portfolios and mitigating risks.

## Repository Structure

- `dimensionality_reduction/`: Python scripts for step-by-step implementations of the discussed dimensionality reduction techniques.
- `clustering/`: Python scripts for step-by-step implementations of the discussed clustering techniques.

## Usage

The python scripts provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the analysis. Each script is self-contained and can be executed independently.
