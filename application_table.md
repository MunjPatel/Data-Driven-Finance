# **Summary of Multivariate Data Analysis Methods in Risk Management**

| **Method**       | **Application**                | **Outcome**                                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PCA**           | Portfolio Risk Analysis       | Identifies systemic risk drivers and simplifies portfolio VaR computation.                   |
| **LDA**           | Credit Risk Categorization    | Separates borrowers into categories based on financial metrics, minimizing classification risk. |
| **t-SNE**         | Detecting Market Anomalies    | Highlights local clusters or anomalies in financial market data.                             |
| **K-Means**       | Portfolio Diversification     | Groups similar assets to reduce concentration risk.                                          |
| **Hierarchical**  | Systemic Risk Detection       | Reveals relationships and co-movement among assets during crises.                           |
| **DBSCAN**        | Outlier Detection             | Flags outliers and irregular patterns in market data for further investigation.              |

## **1. PCA: Portfolio Risk Analysis**
- **Application**: PCA identifies systemic risks in a portfolio by isolating key factors contributing to asset volatility.
- **Outcome**: Simplifies portfolio risk management, allowing easier computation of Value-at-Risk (VaR).

---

## **2. LDA: Credit Risk Categorization**
- **Application**: Categorizes borrowers into credit risk groups based on financial metrics such as income, debt ratio, and payment history.
- **Outcome**: Minimizes classification risk by optimizing the separation of risk classes.

---

## **3. t-SNE: Detecting Market Anomalies**
- **Application**: Detects hidden clusters or anomalies in financial datasets by preserving local structures in high-dimensional data.
- **Outcome**: Highlights irregular patterns or potential risks in market data.

---

## **4. K-Means: Portfolio Diversification**
- **Application**: Groups similar assets based on return profiles and risk characteristics to improve diversification.
- **Outcome**: Reduces concentration risk by identifying clusters of assets behaving similarly.

---

## **5. Hierarchical Clustering: Systemic Risk Detection**
- **Application**: Visualizes relationships and dependencies among assets using a dendrogram structure.
- **Outcome**: Identifies systemic risks, such as assets that co-move during financial crises.

---

## **6. DBSCAN: Outlier Detection**
- **Application**: Flags outliers and irregular patterns in stock returns or other financial datasets.
- **Outcome**: Detects anomalies that may indicate risk or market inefficiencies.
